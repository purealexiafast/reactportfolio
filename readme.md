# React Portfolio

Author Alexia Fast

## Description

This assignment was to create a portfolio using React. I incorporated an "About Me", "Contact", "Portfolio" and "Projects" section and populated it with relevant information. Using react was a new experience, and I found it so useful. I will be continuing to use React in the future.
